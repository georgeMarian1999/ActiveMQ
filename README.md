# ActiveMQ
A laboratory project I've worked on in the second year of study for Systems for Design and Implementation course
The programming language used is Java. The project is a mock client server project using Spring for Objects and ActiveMQ as a messaging broker.
ActiveMQ is used to update the GUI of one client when another is making a change in the app.
